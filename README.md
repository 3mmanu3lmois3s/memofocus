# MemoFocus

MemoFocus is a didactic game available on web and mobile platforms, developed in JavaScript. It aims to train your focus, patience, accuracy, and memory. My original idea with this game is that could be resolve by high potential people. I don't know because i am not psycho... but the game could be achieved, I know it!!
